- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned or reviewed

- Bootstrap: Building website by utilising the Navigation Bar, Grid layout, Carousel, fluid container, Card classes setting

- CSS: Z-index and positioning to set the stacking order of elements; 

```css
.img {
  position: absolute;
  index: 1;
}
```

- Others: Adding media query to modify the layout of the page;
- Ohters: Refactoring codes to increase the readability of the codes;
- Others: CSS Selector




### Continued development

- Bootstrap 5.1.3 is used during the coding process for the website, I need to study the differences between it and Bootstrap 4.0, which is used in the tutorial;
